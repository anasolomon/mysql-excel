1. Took data from an excel file which contained information about "car repair shops"'s city/address/phone/email, "cat mechanics"'s ID of car repair shop/surname/name/city/address/ phone/date of birth, "cars"'s plate number/brand/model/registration year, "repairs"'s mechanis's ID/plate number/date of repair/description/hours of work spent on repair/price.   
2. Used Excel formulas to INSERT INTO 4 different tables with each representing one of these different tables with all their respective datas that I listed before. All the Excel command output was copied and pasted into a "popola.sql" ment to populate the tables in the Database "autoficina". 
3. Created table structures with their respective primary key and foreign key/s making relationships in "crea.sql".  
4. Created a query in "query.sql" where we elencate firsty the 'Volkswagen' cars ordering them by age, then a query where we show mechanics's name/surname/dob if they reside in the city 'Casale Monferrato' and order them by age in a crescent way. The next query shows the hours worked/amount paid/plate number from the repair shop from mechanic 'Rosso Antonio' ordered by Date. Last query shows mechanics that work in the same city they reside in.
